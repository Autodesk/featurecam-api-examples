# addin-featurecam-to-eureka

Addin for FeatureCAM that exports stock, clamps, workpiece, tools, nc code and other required data from FeatureCAM to EUREKA.

This add-in requires that Eureka be installed on the computer in order to compile (or execute).   A Eureka library is used, and template files are extracted from the Eureka installation at runtime.
