# Contributing to FeatureCAM API Examples

The FeatureCAM team will consider contributions to these example plugins in accordance with the guidelines below.

## Contributing code

To contribute fixes or enhancements to these plugin examples, please:

1. Submit a pull request which clearly describes the purpose of the code change.
- What is the issue and how it is fixed?
- What is the new feature and how is it used?
2. Follow the coding style that is already used in the source code.
3. Describe how you have tested the changes.
4. Include a screenshot showing changes to the UI, if any.
5. The FeatureCAM team will review requests in the order they are received.
4. If a reviewed PR requires changes by the owner, the owner of the PR has 30 days to respond. If the PR has seen no activity by the next session, it will be either closed by the team or perhaps taken over by someone on the team.

## Contribution "Bar"

The FeatureCAM team will merge changes that fix bugs or enhance the ability of other users to use these plugins as templates for extending these interfaces or creating new ones.

The FeatureCAM team will not merge changes that have narrowly-defined benefits, nor will large enhancements be merged.  This is because we do not maintain current copies of the target software (Vericut, NCSimul, Camplete, Eureka) and have no way to verify the changes.

Note that the plugins that are currently distributed with the FeatureCAM product are built from a separate copy of this source.   Contributions may or may not be merged back into the source for the plugins distributed with FeatureCAM.
